    "description": "Long hill and running training that you still have the feeling for the setup from last week?!\n\nWarm up with a distance jog to a hill you know. The hill should not be \"too steep\" but nicely runnable all the way.\n\nAfter the warm-up, you do some light mobility and then at the beginning of \"your hill\" you do running training before the hill session itself.\n\nRunning training exercises run you on a 20 meter stretch up your hill. Rest once down. We increase to 2x20 meters of all the exercises or if you think it's a lot, you choose exercise 2-4-5.\n\n1x20m of:\n\n1. Low Skip\n\n2. High Skip\n\n3. Bouncing steps\n\n4. Multistep\n\n5. Heel kick every\n\nAfter the heel kick you have got your heart rate up a bit and can start your \"hill\".\n\nFocus on finding the right pace and running \"just right for the hill\".\n\nThe goal is to have approx. 60 seconds in the uphill. (50-70 seconds ok). You run nicely and controlled uphill, and get a little tired. Stop and rest for a few seconds at the \"top\" or where you turn, then jog down leisurely to the start. Repeat and run a total of 17-19 minutes on the hill. In the \"total time\" you include both the run up and the jog down and also the small rest time at the top. (keep the clock rolling).",
