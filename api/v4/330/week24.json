Finish image at a speed of around 5.30 min/km.\n\nIf you are tired and your body is not responding; run calmly all the way through.\n\nAs always important drink, and energy and more fluids even afterwards for good and important recovery!\n\nRegarding if this is your last long session before the marathon, you can actually if you missed many long sessions, put in a short leisurely long session with a week to go before the race instead of specified training.
