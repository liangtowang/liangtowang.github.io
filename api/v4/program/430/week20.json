    "description": "A week where we focus on Thursday's interval training and then a slightly shorter long training session for the weekend to keep the long training feeling going and at the same time give the body a chance to absorb all the tough training - and be ready for the last really tough weeks of the program including our two longest training sessions. So shorter now - to be able to gear up a notch to later.\n\nAre you running the Premier Half on Saturday?, well then you change the week and skip the long session and take the race as your tough training this weekend!\n\nThursday's speed session would you be able to sleep on Tuesday, then you just go for a leisurely jog on Thursday before the race!"

    "description": "Today we will run an interval ladder where we increase the speed the shorter the intervals become. First, we warm up as usual with a leisurely distance jog that takes you to your interval distance. Aim to get to a stretch/round where you can get in 3 minutes of interval speed running without too much hilling.\n\nAfter the warm-up calm run, you first do some mobility and then we put in the week's running training. Run your exercises as you like, and with a range of motion adapted to you and your habit of running training. Then round off the warm-up with two pulse-raising coordination runs and then 1-2 minutes of rest before starting the interval part.\n\nWe run an interval-setup a little adapted so that you could run this together with one/some running buddies, even if you are at different levels. Because then you/you can run \"forward/backward\" on the same distance as the interval steps we will run constantly repeat an interval length twice. (Forward + backward will make you always end up in the same place after every second interval regardless of level)\n\nRiding alone or with a friend, you can of course drive the session forward on a lap if it feels more stimulating than the forward/back layout.\n\nRegardless of the layout, the goal is that you work at a higher speed the shorter the interval time/distance. Keep in mind, however, that in the initial 3 minutes you take it \"just right\" so you find the right fit in the session.\n\nWe rest the same throughout the session of 1 minute standing/walking between each interval.\n\nThe layout of the interval steps will be: \n\nThe interval steps: 2 x 3 min – 2 x 2 min – 2 x 1 min followed by 2 x 2 min – 2 x 1 min\n\n12 + 6 minutes, a total of 18 minutes of interval time. (In time approx. 4 km)\n\nDirectional speeds:\n\n3 minutes: 4.39 min/km in time approx. 645m\n\n2 minutes: 4.25 min/km in time approx. 450m\n\n1 minute: 4.15 min/km in time approx. 235m \n\nAfter the interval part, you round off as usual with a downhill jog and stretch.",
