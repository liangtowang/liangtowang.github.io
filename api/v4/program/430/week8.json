    "description": "Good three-session week where our short intervals return so that you can work with a different step than at distance/threshold and so that you can work a little on your fitness development. 12 x 200 meters straight will be this week's speed session.\n\nBut before that we run distance and strength on Tuesday and then we work up the long session to a half marathon on Sunday!\n\nSo really long on Sunday, but at exactly your leisurely long session pace. Hope everything feels good and you are charged for a new step in your training.â€‹"

    "description": "Our short intervals will return; now with 5 more intervals than the last time we ran the session and no series rest but 12 x 200 meters straight. Warm up with light jogging, mobility and some coordination runs.\n\nThen short intervals, where we run 12 x 200 m or if you run on a \"clock\" you take 12 x 50 seconds. The rest is standing/walking 40 seconds , which means that you can get up to speed and keep a good speed without pushing everything for the sake of it. Have a gear saved. It is and should be a session where you \"just\" should be reasonably tired. An \"easy way\" to work on your fitness and oxygen uptake at the same time that you will muscularly work a little with your faster muscle fibers.\n\nGuided speed if you want it can be to lie in 4.10-4.15 min/km at speed. (Gives 50-51 seconds per 200 meters)\n\nRelax with a leisurely jog and stretch the muscles thoroughly. The calves and backs of the thigh muscles are usually strained a little extra by the \"overrun\".",
