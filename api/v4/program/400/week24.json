    "description": "Now begins our tapering off for this year's ASICS Stockholm Marathon.\n\nNow it is more about starting to find flow and the rhythm than \"moving forward\" so much on the individual sessions.\n\nHave you managed to follow the program broadly, I think you're doing well and now you're making a lot of money by starting to reduce your training.\n\nStarting with some much-needed quiet days, after last week's tough overall and tough long sessions. If you want, you can shorten the Tuesday session to an even shorter leisurely jog.\n\nThis week's tough session will be the fast distance. There you can go hard if everything feels ok.\n\nLong session at a leisurely pace, but for those who feel that the body has responded well to recent training, you can add a good increase in speed to the session.\n\nLast chance also to in the long session moment try maran's sports drink. -So you haven't done it before; test now and see if it works; also applies to shoes and clothes. Try out what you'll wear on the maran!\n\nGood luck with the week!"
