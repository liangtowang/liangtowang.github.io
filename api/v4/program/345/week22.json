The feeling of long workouts is of course good to maintain - but the coach intends to make it shorter this year so you can recharge for the following week's longest long workouts"

If a long session can feel short?\n\nThe session maintains your long session feeling, but hopefully gives the body a chance to absorb all the training.\n\nCoach Szalkai wants this slightly shorter long session to now give you a small \"buffer\" both mentally and physically before the upcoming last tough part of the program - before the tapering starts towards the marathon, which is now only less than 4 weeks away.\n\nSo calm base speed and a little shorter, but of course with the usual long-run advice where drink/energy is included and that you be careful after the session with dry clothes and new energy in so you don't open up to catching an unnecessary cold now!",
