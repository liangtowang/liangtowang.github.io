The feeling of long workouts is of course good to maintain - but the coach intends to make it shorter this year so you can recharge for the following week's longest long workouts"

    "description": "We continue with threshold Thursday, and now develop the session a little more with an even longer continuous run. A total of 30 minutes again, but according to the model, the speed bits are 12-10-8 minutes or if you drive on a distance meter about 2 km1.85 km1.5 km. We take a 2-minute walk or a certain amount of calm jogging as a rest between each threshold section.\n\nStart the first 12 minutes of the threshold soft, and then work on a little harder. Target picture that you maintain approximately 5.25 min/km on the 12 minute timer, 5.15-5.20 speed on the 10 minute threshold and then you can allow yourself to drop the threshold speed a little and faster than your threshold on the second half of the 8 minute, so maybe down to 5.05-5.10 min/km at the end of the 8-minute run.\n\nThe speeds assume that the winter is ok with you and if you start from effort, you make sure that the 12-minute run feels adequate (a little faster than distance running) and then you dare to get tired in the final 8-minute run .\n\nThen unwind as usual with a leisurely jog and stretch.",
