    "description": "Today the plan is for us to run a combination variant with both some long but also short slopes. For volume for the run, we take a distance warm-up of 3 km. Then the running training before the back start. On the hill, we run by number instead of time, but make a short estimate that it will take around 17-18 minutes and will be at least 2 km in total. The set-up will be 3x60 second hills, followed by 4x40 seconds and ending on the hill with 4x20 second hills. The time indicated in the uphill and rest between each hill is a light jog down the hill and a 5-10 second standing rest at the \"up\" and \"down\" turns. Try to come up with a plan where the long hills go in at a speed where you can run \"nice\" and without getting completely exhausted. Work harder on the 40-second hill and then on the 20-second hill, I hope the hill is short enough that you can bounce uphill with good pressure. The choice of slope is based on the assumption that you will be able to handle the slope on the long slope, so do not choose a slope that is \"too steep\".",
