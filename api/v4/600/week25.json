    "description": "One more step down in volume to give the body even more chance to create a top shape. Two of this week's sessions contain good quality aspects for the form.\n\nOxygen uptake, endurance at high speed and flow via short intervals on Thursday. Flexible and running technique via the hill and some short marathon flow there as well in the week's final session.\n\nTo keep the feeling going, we add two lighter distance sessions, where you can easily remove the Saturday session if you know that running rest usually gives a good effect directly to light legs. But if you feel; ok to jog on... Mentally; slowly begin to look forward to the goals of the entire training plan. Only one week away!!\n\nGood luck with the week, it's getting close!!"

That is, 4 intervals with 45 sec rest, and then 90 sec rest before you run 4 more, etc. Target speed is around 45-47 sec per 200m (3.45-3.55 pace), Important, however, more flow/harmony is to push max. With 12 intervals, you have time to get good training both muscularly and for fitness! Relax calmly with jogging/stretching.",

    "description": "We \"check off the runes\", and here comes a last resilience-giving back run together with short threshold flow. In addition to working with good strides, the hill always maintains your fitness in a superb way and with the threshold you can float on in a little \"sub marathon\" Warm-up jog of 2km, then the mini running training in the opposite slope. 1x20m; Low Skip-High Skip-Multistep-Heel Kick each. Then the short hill, with a focus on good strides and getting \"fairly tired\". 8-10 slopes that take around 25 seconds up, and easy walking/jogging down. Take rest time \"down\" so the step up will be good!! After the hill you rest a bit and if necessary you move with a light jog to a stretch where you can float at sub marathon speed for 2 km. Much like the speed increase on the long run, but without it being in a long run. Find the flow and feel that the passion is finally here!!",
