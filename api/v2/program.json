    "plan":"This week we start our training for the Stockholm Marathon.\n\nStart-up week in the four-hour program where we show a slightly tougher start with both short long runs directly and a distance run supplemented with some easy speed runs called coordination runs.\n\nBecause the program doesn't know how your training autumn looks like, the start can be a bit tough if it is the case that the start of the program is also the start of your running. If you feel that you have not practiced running before, start a little more calmly than indicated by running a little shorter on the Sunday session.\n\nThe basic speed of the program for easy distances is 5.40-5.50 min/km and is based on your goal of 4 hours. We simply run the distance almost at your marathon race pace.\n\nBut the pace is very individual, so your leisurely pace may not be at all on the program's leisurely distance pace of 5.40 min to 5.50 min per km, but it may be at 5.30 or 6.00 minutes per km so that the leisurely distance is calm and the running feels natural.\n\nTAKE YOUR leisurely pace and start from it in the program and follow the km instructions, thus modifying the time to your time over the distance.\n\nI hope the week is working well, and this feels like a fitting start to our 26 weeks together!",

We will have the moment in the future, but usually in the warm-up before quality running. \n\nTry to be with the moment, without pressing or stressing and risking stretching. The rest between your coordinations is a leisurely walk back to the starting point. \n\nToday we introduce this with 3 x 80-100 meters. If you don't have a distance, take 5x20 seconds for simplicity's sake (without it being your speed). \n\nRun nice and high; see yourself as a nicely running elite runner....with an active front foot. \n\nNOTE; if it is very wintry and slippery, you wait to introduce the coordination races.",

(Often called lactic acid). A bit hard to describe, but if you're above it, it can only be a few notches faster than your distance running and the more you're used to the pace, the closer you can be to your limit and dare to push something more.\n\nSo try to find the position where you lie down for a while and get \"just tired\" like that. Then you will move your threshold a little bit with the help of the passport.\n\nSo at the beginning it is better to go a little too slowly than too fast. So comfortably tired!\n\nBefore you start the main part, you take a short calm distance warm-up and some mobility.\n\nThen you are ready for the start and the goal today is to run 10 x 3 minutes threshold. A total of 30 minutes of threshold running. Take a 30 second rest with a light jog or walk between each section.\n\nPlease note that it is just THRESHOLD and not intervals, even though today we are breaking it up into so many shorter runs.\n\nDo you want a target speed and don't just go by feel, a guideline can be around 5.20-5.25 min/km, so slightly faster than your intended marathon pace. That speed will give you around 550 meters per each 3-minute segment.\n\nRewind with a leisurely jog as the end of the session and briefly stretch the running muscles.",

        "description":"Today a nice Christmas long run with the goal of reaching the same distance length as last week on the long run with the addition of a small speed element to change the step during your long run.\n\nThis of course assumes that you have ok winter surfaces to be able to increase the speed and that the weather in general allows for a slightly higher heart rate and breathing.\n\nRide calmly for around an hour, and then you add 5 x 1 minute speed increases with 1 minute rest between each speed section.\n\nIt is not an interval, but the idea is to you increase the speed in your 1 minute by around 15-20 seconds faster in kilometer speed than the base speed you have on the rest of the session.\n\nIn the calm minute you have between each speed increase, you take a slightly slower speed than you normally have as your base speed on the long pass.\n\nAfter the speed section, you return to your base speed and complete today's 18 km distance.\n\nIn addition, you should remember to bring fluids with you during the long pass, even if it is winter. For \"short long sessions\" like this, water can be enough, but since we are going to drive a little faster, it can also feel good to get some energy via sports drink.\n\nAlso think about getting energy as soon as possible after the session so you speed up your recovery after the session. Grab a banana or maybe a recovery drink right after your workout.",

It is and should be a session where you \"just\" should be reasonably tired. An \"easy way\" to work on your fitness and oxygen uptake at the same time that you will work a little with your faster muscle fibers. Warm up with light jogging, mobility and some coordination runs. Then our short interval, where we will have a really short rest to keep the speed from getting too high. We run 10 x 200 m or if you run on \"clock\" you take 10 x 50 seconds. The rest is standing for 30 seconds, which means that you should not run too fast, but only a few notches faster than your distance run. Find your rhythm and if you feel that it feels good, you can push a little more in the last 2-3 intervals if you feel like it, but overall a \"just enough pass\". Guideline, if you want it, can be a bit over 4.00 min/km in speed. Wind down with a leisurely jog and thoroughly stretch your muscles after you put in the week's running strength. So a great session today with many moments!",

If you want/need to take a standing rest so that it feels comfortably tough, take a full standing rest.\n\nBut rather slow down the pace so you can walk/jog between each threshold section.\n\nThen you will also keep the heat better :) Relax with calm jogging.\n\nDo you have a New Year's run in your plan?

        "description":"No traditional long session today, but the goal is to collect the volume you had on your long session last week via \"threshold sections\". Keep in mind that if the session FEELS TOO TOUGH, you can easily convert it into a \"normal\" long session at your leisurely base speed. But of course the coach hopes that it feels good and you want to try the set-up, which aims to push your fitness/threshold speed and your mental and physical strength to run a little faster even when we run long!\n\nAs the beginning and end of the session, you should run at your normal \"calm\" long-pass speed. Speed of speech is what matters, and the feeling should be calm. Both the beginning and the end create a bit of the day's \"km volume\".\n\nBetween the beginning and the end, the idea is that you should work on your marathon speed and your threshold speed divided into different kilometer sections with a quiet running rest (or walking rest) between each mara/threshold speed part . This will build up the volume of the session\n\nOur volume goal with the entire session in total is today 20 km and both the introduction, the speed parts and the end can be a little flexible so you can adapt this to your Round. But you can see a suggested layout below, including target speeds that you of course adapt to possible winter conditions and cold weather.\n\nIf you don't have a watch that indicates speed, you go by feel where you should dare to \"lay on\" a little more during the speed parts than you normally have on your long run and feel a little more speed the shorter the speed part.\n\nIntroduction and finish at 6.00 pace, and the rest run between each speed part is around 6.10-6.20 pace.\n\nIntroduction approx. 5 km. (Ok stop and run a few minutes of effective mobility, after the distance introduction)\n\nSpeed parts 3 km - 2 km - 2 km - 1 km - 1 km - 1 km (total 10 km speed and approx. 2.5 km rest)\n\ nBetween every 3-4 minutes of leisurely running. If the group/coaches want to run the exact length of the \"rest\", it will be a \"jog\" of 500 meters.\n\nThe finish will be around 2.5 km, assuming a running rest of about 500 meters between each speed section. At the end, the total distance can be adjusted so that you reach the 20 km distance goal.\n\nThe target speeds:\n\n3 km â€“ 5.41 min/km (marathon speed)\n\n2 km â€“ 5.33 min/km\n\n1 km â€“ 5.23 min/ km where you get if you want to push a little extra on the last 1 km down to Around 5.11 min/km.",

        "description":"No increase in distance length today, but in return the goal is a long session with an increase in speed included - provided it works with your winter.\n\nThe idea is that today you add in 3 x 5 minutes of speed increases with 2 minutes of calm running between each speed section. Let the speed part come Around halfway into the session, but more important than \"when the speed comes\" is that the barrel element fits into your Round.\n\nTo get a good feel for this speed part, you can put in a 1 minute \" switch the speed part\" step before starting the 5 minute speed parts. Run the \"minute\" at your comfortably fast pace, and let it build up your leg speed/stride and heart rate.\n\nTake 1-2 minutes of easy running after this \"warm-up\" speed portion, before then starting your 5 minutes speed splits.\n\nThe goal in speeding your \"5 minutes\" is to maintain your marathon average speed to reach the time goal or even slightly faster. So concretely, your target image can be 5.30-5.40 in minutes per kilometer.\n\nWe set 2 minutes as a calm pace between the speed parts, but this part can be a little flexible, so you can get to your 5 minute speed parts on a relatively flat stretch. The speed on the calmer part can be around 10-15 seconds slower in min/km than your normal long pass speed.\n\nAfter the pace you take a few minutes really easy before you find your normal long pass speed and complete the pass so you reach the day's distance goal .\n\nDon't forget to bring drinks to the session, and feel free to take something with energy before starting the speed part!\n\nNOTE; should the winter not \"allow\" speed elements today, well then you drive a normal long session and skip the speed sections.",

The goal is to have clearly higher speed than during your distance running, and it should be a relatively tough session. It's important that you don't run too fast in the first intervals, because then it will easily become an inharmonious session with lactic acid in the legs right from the start. Start in time, and aim for the last intervals to be your fastest. We aim to complete a full 6 intervals, if it feels too much, take one or two intervals less. Rest 1 minute stationary between each interval. So the passport in short; 6x800 meters or 6 x 3.45 with 1 minute rest. (guideline speed Around 4.45 min/km) We will increase the speed slightly on the intervals later in the program.

        "description":"Today we're going to run a new element of the program that the coach calls \"marathon crunches\", and it simply means that instead of a regular long run, you must accumulate long run volume by running many \"calm\" 1 km intervals.\n\nIn the long run volume that is created, we also count up and down by 2-3km.\n\nSo start the session with a few kilometers of leisurely running. Stop and do some mobility for your joints/ligaments and running muscles. If you want, you can also include some simple and softening running training exercises. Then you're ready to start your 1 km intervals.\n\nA target speed might be to run around 25-35 seconds faster in minutes per kilometer than your normal long run pace. In order to get an optimal setup, you can advantageously start the first 1 km intervals a little slower/calmer than the specified \"guide speed\", so maybe \"only\" 20 seconds faster than the long pass pace, in order to then have the capacity to increase the speed a little afterwards and that the last The 1 km intervals will be the fastest - even though you then have the most volume in your legs.\n\nWe adjust the number of intervals based on how long the intervals take, so the faster the runner, the more intervals.\n\nSo for you with 4:00 as a time goal today we aim to run 16 x 1 km and the target speed after you get started will be Around 5:35 down to 5:25 min/km if we start from 6:00 min/km at long pass pace.\n\nThe rest between every \"marathon tussle\" you take a 45-60 second standing/walking rest.\n\nEven if it's not a long session, you will be out for a long time with ups and downs, so feel free to bring a drink with you during the session, and especially today when you want to run faster, it may be time to drink energy at some of the rests or some energy gel. (or whatever you like)\n\nMentally; don't think about how many you have left at the beginning, but focus on your running technique, to run relaxed but still \"active\", because now you should have a slightly more active step than your normal long-pass step. After a while, there are \"only\" a few intervals left, and then you can start counting down!\n\nAfter the last intervals, exhale before finishing the session with a few kilometers of calm deceleration and finished easy mobility for the running muscles that have had to work!",

Short effective running training and pulse-raising coordination.\n\nThen you start the threshold workout. Target image is 7 x 1 km and your target speed will be around 5.10-5.15 min/km at pace.

        "description":"Today we run a long session with an element of speed again. So no increase in time or kilometer length, but instead the focus is on getting in a speed section. If you already feel from the beginning of the session that it might be tough with speed today, then you skip the long speed section (the km parts) and only run the initial 30-45-60 seconds to change steps in your long session.\n\nStart up the long pass at your usual speed and roll on to about half the distance of today's total distance goal. Decide where the speed element is based on where it fits into your round. The speed portion begins with 30 seconds of fast running, 1 minute easy, 45 seconds fast, 1 minute easy, 60 seconds fast and then 2 minutes easy. On these speed parts, the focus is that you should work with good technique and speed up your legs and get your heart rate up a bit. The layout should be your comfortably fast speed and no focus here to have any heading speed. Run with feeling, and run nicely. \n\nCome up to the step and try to run with a proud posture, and you will engage unused muscle power.\n\nAfter 2 minutes of calm basic speed after the 60 second speed increase comes the main speed part where there will be a few kilometer speed parts.\n\nThe speed parts will be 3 km1 km1 km.\n\nGuided speeds:\n\n3 km 5.30-5.35 min/km.\n\n1 km 5.10-5.15 min/km.\n\nBetween each km speed increase part, 2 minutes of calm long-pass basic speed or even calmer applies . (If you need to, you can walk a little bit in the 2 minute \"rest part\") On the last speed increase part, you can increase it even harder in the last minute of the km speed part. But not so fast that you risk injury.\n\nAfter finishing the speed part, you take a 3-minute really calm jog or walk where you can take the opportunity to drink. However, do not stop for too long, but then start up again to your usual long-pass base speed and then complete the long pass so that you reach the day's distance goal.",

Walking rest down the running training distance. Think about good posture and active steps.\n\nThen we start the downhill session itself, and it will be a session where we will work with both longer and shorter slopes.\n\nThe purpose of the session will be to work on running technique, running strength and fitness but also a little different \"pressure in the step\" during the session.\n\nWe start with some 60 second (takes approx. 60 seconds uphill) long hills where we work with good technique but without pushing too much. We run \"nice and controlled\" uphill.\n\nGood to take the first long hill as part of the warm-up.\n\nWhen we then switch to an intermediate variant in the time uphill, it will be a 40-second running time uphill and now you try to increase the pressure in the step a notch but not tougher than that on the closing short \"20 second downhills\" we can increase pressure, range of motion and posture another notch.\n\nThe rest between the slopes is that you stop and rest for a few seconds where we turn, and then we jog down to the start and take a few seconds' rest before starting again.\n\nOn the longer slopes, the jog down can preferably be a little faster, but on the shorter slopes, the jog down can be really calm and preferably also a little the beginning and end of \"the transport is brought down\".\n\nBetween the changes of the hill length, you can also take a few seconds of extra standing rest below the hill so that you are ready to push a notch more on the next variation of the hill length.\n\nYour target picture today will be to run the following number of hills in the respective time length up:\n\n4 x 60 seconds\n\n5 x 40 seconds\n\n5 x 20 seconds\n\nAfter the hill run, you wind down with a leisurely jog followed by some form of stretching.",

Also feel free to do some coordination to get your pulse and speed up before the interval part starts.\n\nThe layout of the interval session will be 200 meter intervals, divided into series with 4 intervals in each series. The rest is 30 seconds of \"standing rest\" between intervals, and then you take 60 seconds of standing/walking rest between each set. The goal picture will be 16 intervals in total, so 4 x 4 x 200 meters.\n\nReally short rest today, which means that the speed should not be pressured or high, but the short rest ensures a good conditioning effect and transfer to your marathon pace will be included supermarginal :)\n\nThe program (and you) should continue to focus on foundational cardio training, but the goal is of course also to get your legs moving without risking injuries through running too fast.\n\nRun through the session with \"one gear left\" , and focus on your technique. Good stately posture and active step. Let the drive of the arms help with the speed without being tempted to sprint for the sake of it!\n\nTarget speed around 4.10-4.15 min/km, which gives around 50-51 seconds per 200 meters.\n\nEnd the session as usual with jogging mobility.",

        "description":"Today we run here with the program a combination interval session with long and short intervals. We will repeat the interval series 2 x 3 minutes followed by 4 x 40 seconds As usual before the speed part of the session you start with a warm-up run. Let the warm-up take you to your inspiring interval stretch. You can run the intervals back and forth on the same distance, but of course you can also \"graze\" the intervals forward on your round. If you want, it is also very good to run the session on the treadmill, and then you can even start from a fixed distance on the intervals and let the time be around 3 minutes on \"your long\" and around 40 seconds on your short intervals. Regardless of where you run the intervals, however, the interval distance should not be too hilly; and there will be a hump; you adjust the speed and do not chase average speed. When you have warmed up with your leisurely run, do some dynamic mobility and preferably also some warm-up and running training exercises. Then you finish the warm-up part with a coordination run/increase run. Then you are ready for the intervals, where you can start from the \"guidelines\" but your feeling is most important and then it is important that you find a good flow in the \"long\" 3 minute intervals while at the same time allowing ourselves some fatigue. In the 40 second intervals, you can dare to step up even more and really work well with your speed. Rest is 1 minute standing/walking between and after the 3 minute intervals and then 40 seconds standing/walking after each 40 second interval. When you have run a full series of 2 x 3 minutes followed by 4 x 40 seconds, you take a series rest of around 1-1.5 minutes. Here you decide how long you need to recharge. The target image here with the program will be the following arrangement: 2 SERIES where each series contains 2 x 3 minutes followed by 4 x 40 seconds. 1 SET of 1 x 3 minutes followed by 2 x 40 seconds. (Total interval time 21:40 min) 3 minute target speed: 4.40 min/km. Gives about 640 meters per interval. 40 second target speed: 4.06 min/km. Gives about 165 meters per interval.

        "description":"Today, the session that the coach calls \"marathon thousand\" returns. We had it in the program at the end of February, and now we are running again and also adding two \"Marathon tweens\".\n\nThe pass means that you must accumulate long-pass volume by running many \"calm\" 1 km intervals. In the long-pass volume that is created, we also include a warm-up of 2-3 km and a cool-down of 2-3 km.\n\nSo start the session with a leisurely run for a few kilometers. Stop and do some mobility for your joints/ligaments and running muscles. If you want, you can also include some simple and softening running training exercises. Then you're ready to start your 1 km intervals.\n\nThe goal is to run around 30-40 seconds faster in minutes per kilometer than your normal long run pace.\n\nOptimize your setup by starting the first 1 km intervals a little slower/calmer than the specified \"guide speed\", so that you can then increase the speed a little later and that the last 1 km interval will be the fastest - even though you then have the most volume in your legs.\n\nFor you with a fast 4:00 who time goal is the goal of 18 x 1 km and the target speed after you get started will be around 5:30-5:20 min/km if we start from 6:00 at a long pass pace.\n\nThe rest between each \"Maraton tussing\" you take 60 seconds standing /walking rest.\n\nBring drinks out on the pass, and maybe even some energy gel. (or anything else you like with energy)\n\nMental; think positively and that you actually get to rest, which you don't get during the long session as regularly as now. Take it one step at a time, and look forward to the feeling you get when you've done 18 reps!\n\nAfter the 18th interval, you exhale before finishing the session with a few kilometers of calm deceleration and finished easy mobility for the running muscles that have had to work!",

        "description":"Today we will run an interval ladder where we increase the speed the shorter the intervals become. First, we warm up as usual with a leisurely distance jog that takes you to your interval distance. Aim to get to a stretch/round where you can get in 3 minutes of interval speed running without too much hilling.\n\nAfter the warm-up calm run, you first do some mobility and then we put in the week's running training. Run your exercises as you like, and with a range of motion adapted to you and your habit of running training. Then round off the warm-up with two pulse-raising coordination runs and then 1-2 minutes of rest before starting the interval part.\n\nWe run an interval-setup a little adapted so that you could run this together with one/some running buddies, even if you are at different levels. Because then you/you can run \"forward/backward\" on the same distance as the interval steps we will run constantly repeat an interval length twice. (Forward + backward will make you always end up in the same place after every second interval regardless of level)\n \nRiding alone or with a friend, you can of course drive the session forward on a lap if it feels more stimulating than the forward/back layout.\n\nRegardless of the layout, the goal is that you work at a higher speed the shorter the interval time/distance. Keep in mind, however, that in the initial 3 minutes you take it \"just right\" so you find the right fit in the session.\n\nWe rest the same throughout the session of 1 minute standing/walking between each interval.\n\nThe layout of the interval steps will be: \n\nThe interval steps: 2 x 3 min â€“ 2 x 2 min â€“ 2 x 1 min followed by 2 x 2 min â€“ 2 x 1 min\n\n12 + 6 minutes, a total of 18 minutes of interval time. (In time approx. 4 km)\n\nDirectional speeds:\n\n3 minutes: 4.39 min/km in time approx. 645m\n\n2 minutes: 4.25 min/km in time approx. 450m\n\n1 minute: 4.15 min/km in time approx. 235m \n\nAfter the interval part, you round off as usual with a downhill jog and stretch.",

Then the running training before the back start. On the hill, we run by number instead of time, but make a short estimate that it will take around 17-18 minutes and will be at least 2 km in total. The set-up will be 3x60 second hills, followed by 4x40 seconds and ending on the hill with 4x20 second hills. The time indicated in the uphill and rest between each hill is a light jog down the hill and a 5-10 second standing rest at the \"up\" and \"down\" turns. Try to come up with a plan where the long hills go in at a speed where you can run \"nice\" and without getting completely exhausted. Work harder on the 40-second hill and then on the 20-second hill, I hope the hill is short enough that you can bounce uphill with good pressure. The choice of slope is based on the assumption that you will be able to handle the slope on the long slope, so do not choose a slope that is \"too steep\".",

        "description":"We \"check off the passes\", and here comes a last resilience-giving back pass together with short threshold flow. In addition to working with good strides, the hill always maintains your fitness in a superb way and with the threshold you can float on in a little \"sub marathon\" Warm-up jog of 2km, then the mini running training in the opposite slope. 1x20m; Low Skip-High Skip-Multistep-Heel Kick each. Then the short hill, with a focus on good strides and getting \"fairly tired\". 8-10 slopes that take around 25 seconds up, and easy walking/jogging down. Take rest time \"down\" so the step up will be good!! After the hill you rest a bit and if necessary you move with a light jog to a stretch where you can float at sub marathon speed for 2 km. Much like the speed increase on the long pass, but without it being in a long pass. Find the flow and feel that the passion is finally here!!",

    "plan":"This week's training is completely aimed at optimizing you mentally and physically for Saturday. A few float intervals and easy entertaining distance. Both the intervals and Wednesday's distance workout can be included as a whole in your carbohydrate load. Carbohydrate loading may look a little different. The simplest is to \"just\" from Wednesday eat and drink extra carbohydrate-rich food/liquid up to and including Friday. A slightly more \"advanced\" variant is to lightly empty the body of carbohydrates on Tuesday and Wednesday morning before the actual storage starts on Wednesday. - It happens that on Tuesday you change your diet to include some carbohydrates (eat salad, protein and fat instead) while doing your interval training. The idea is then that the muscles are emptied of carbohydrates, and then you start Wednesday with a run before breakfast (morning jog) which also \"empties\". One theory is that the emptied muscles react to the emptying by being able to store some extra energy. I think the emptying itself also has a mental aspect by telling the body that you are approaching something special; MARAN! - After the Wednesday session, your charging starts by now starting to redirect your diet to contain a lot of carbohydrates. Eat a little extra at each meal, but don't overeat. Supplement with extra snacks on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and treat yourself to some good carbohydrate content! Also supplement the \"eating\" with drinking all the time so that the extra energy can be stored in your muscles. Charging takes place on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, then well on the day of the competition you must be fully charged. NOTE; do not drain if you have a cold or feel sensitive; then you just run the charging and don't risk getting sick because the emptying initially makes you more susceptible to bacteria etc) If you were able to follow the training plan decently, you should take with you that you are WELL prepared. - Good luck with the week and then of course with the race!! /coach Szalkai",

Can feel a bit tough, especially if today you \"walk around\" on a low-carbohydrate diet.\n\nTry to focus on the flow of your run, and run tired, but certainly not too hard. You must have resources saved after the session, you save these for Saturday.\n\nThe purpose of the session is to maintain the feeling of running and that the intervals give the body both muscularly and centrally (heart lungs) a good \"entertaining effect\".\n\nThe session then; Two series with 4 200m or 45 second intervals. 2x4x200m or 2x4x45-50 seconds. The rest is 45 seconds between the intervals and 90 seconds after the 4th interval.\n\nEasy, easy running training in your warm-up, with low skip, medium high skip and heel kick.\n\nIt is important that you cool down calmly, and stretch out the muscles.",

        "description":"Now we are at the final goal of the program.\n\nFinally you will get all the training you put in, and I absolutely believe that if you have followed the program properly it will go really well!!\n\nBut it is a tough job that must be done, and you are set for it!\n\nStart 12.00 or 12.10, so I think you eat your usual breakfast, but maybe not with so much fiber if you usually have fiber breakfast. No need for there to be lumps in the stomach!\n\nFeel free to supplement breakfast with some extra carbohydrate.\n\nMaybe a little sports drink including salt in the early morning, especially if it's hot!\n\nThen if you are used to eating close to the long run, you can also take something light extra at 10.00-10.30; then food energy can wait until after/during the race.\n\nMake sure everything is ready, with shoes, number tag etc.\n\nWarm up a little before the start in the place in your starting line or a short jog before entering the starting line. Feel free to drink water until just before the start, then when you're up and running you can take a sport drink if you know it works for your stomach.\n\nThe start goes; do not stress. You'll make it, stress kills energy!\n\nFind your slightly tougher long run pace (or medium hard distance pace), and break the race into smaller sections, both mentally and physically.\n\nBuildings and buddies can be the split or simply every fluid check !\n\nTake the liquid right from the first check.\n\nYOU WILL DO IT if you are whole and healthy and have managed to follow the program reasonably well.\n\nIf you have followed the time decently on the sessions, 3.59 or faster is also within you if they the external conditions for running are OK on the day of the competition.\n\nOf course it is tough, you have to be prepared that it does not come by itself but that you have to work when it takes.\n\nTake help from the audience, fellow competitors and defeat any slumps!! Change step; work extra with your arms if you get into a slump!!\n\nThink positively, and think that now is the time for all the training to \"get out\"!!\n\nSee you at the Stadium.\n\nGOOD LUCK from coach Anders Szalkai.",
