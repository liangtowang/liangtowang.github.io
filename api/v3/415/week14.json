Low Skip\n\n2. High Skip\n\n3. Bouncing steps\n\n4. Multistep\n\n5. Heel kick every\n\nOn the hill focus on good steps; drive with the whole step and push off right from the \"toes\". RUN \"FINE\", as if someone is pulling your body \"upward on a string\" without losing the power forward...Difficult, but run!!\n\nThe hill gives, regardless of step, technique, a good workout for your steps and technique and also good cardio training!",
