    "description": "A slightly calmer start to the week may be needed, so take a maximum of 6 km there so you can bring home all the training done and to come. Because the rest of the week and the coming weeks are tough. Be responsive and remove/lighten trainings if you need to. The fast distance is long; and tough and late for the weekend, you skip the short downhill section if you are tired. More important to get the long run."
