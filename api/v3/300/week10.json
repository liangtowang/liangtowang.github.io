    "description": "Real volume week with four training sessions for those who feel it works; with that, we can reach a magical 50 km in total in one week!\n\nThe long session continues to increase, and now we are up to about a \"half race\" and we are still not even halfway into the program; so you're good for that!!\n\nNew in this week's training are Thursday's long intervals. Drive that run by feel. If the weather, surface or your body is not 100%, you have to remember not to look too much at direction, but start from your feeling. A tough session, but you shouldn't be completely exhausted. The whole is more important than individual runes!"

    "description": "Today, the idea is that we will run long intervals. We warm up as usual with calm distance speed, easy mobility and coordination runs before the start of the interval. You then run on relatively flat ground either a measured distance of 800 meters or the time indicated on the watch or based on the watch's distance meter. The goal is to have clearly higher speed than during your distance running, and it should be a relatively tough session. It's important that you don't run too fast in the first intervals, because then it will easily become an inharmonious session with lactic acid in the legs right from the start. Start in time, and aim for the last intervals to be your fastest. We aim to complete a full 6 intervals, if it feels too much, take one or two intervals less. Rest 1 minute stationary between each interval. So the training in short; 6x800 meters or 6 x 3.45 with 1 minute rest. (guideline speed Around 4.45 min/km) We will increase the speed slightly on the intervals later in the program. Wind down with a leisurely run and then finish with a good stretch for the running muscles.
