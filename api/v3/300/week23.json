    "description": "A good week with a really tough finish. The goal is to squeeze in a 34 km round for the weekend.\n\n- Good for many mentally to take with you, but if you have done a good long session before, you absolutely do not stand and fall with Sunday's session, but if you are tired, it is completely ok to shorten. You can also skip Saturday's session if you want and feel it is necessary to work towards + 30k the next day.\n\nOther than that, we work with a little speed this week through Thursday's short hill and a marathon session as an introduction which you can shorten to 5-8 km if 10 km feels long just for the day."

Take a few (5-10) seconds of rest both at the turning point of your short hill and before starting the next hill. Focus on a good step with good drive. Work well with slightly faster arm movements and good knee assignments if it comes reasonably naturally to you. No completely unfamiliar movements now...\n\nImportant to unwind with a calm jog and stretch!",

(feel free to try the sports drink if you haven't done it before) Test your intended competition shoes, and see that they work with your feet all the way.\n\nIt is extremely important that you are careful after the session, with energy, drink and dry clothes so that you do not the situation we're in now will catch you with an unnecessary cold.\n\n-Make sure you get an hour's rest after the session, and don't have to do so much before the body has had time to recover a little at least!",
