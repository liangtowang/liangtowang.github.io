    "description": "This week is meant to be a slightly easier week, but I don't really know if almost 40 km is easier? Well now that's it!! So make sure that the first session of the week is really calm and adjust the threshold session according to how you feel in general and of course according to external circumstances. Sunday's long run is what pulls up the week's volume, as the run now stretches out to a full 24 km. If you fix it at a leisurely pace, I think you are well suited to the training plan for the Asics Stockholm Marathon! But if you are tired, shorten the threshold to 2 x 10 min or the long session to Around 20 km."
